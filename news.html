    This is the first news article on the Zalgo site! So, I’ll keep things brief: this article is more of an introduction to us. The site is run by three people, however I will be writing the articles. I’m Rohan, and I do most of the work for Zalgo, whether that be coding software, managing ideas, organizing things, or anything in between. But let’s not ignore the work that Yashas and Michael do (mainly Yashas, as of this article). They are in charge of running, maintaining and managing this website. You wouldn’t be reading this article without them. Additionally, Yashas is currently writing the first Zalgo Operating System in the form of a Linux distribution. So be sure to give them a thanks.. although I’m not sure how you would do that. I suppose just reading this article all the way through is thanks enough (but I’m not speaking for them).<br><br>

    In conclusion, this article marks an important moment for Zalgo. It’s the moment we, a small, young group of innovative minds and rather eccentric individuals, come together to give the world better quality content, without fixating on ‘money, money, money.’ Look, I don’t know about the other guys, but my goal with Zalgo is to make professional apps that cost absolutely no money. So basically, a nonprofit. But the goal is to make not just one app, not just a few, but an entire ecosystem of software designed to make life easier regardless of the task (just as long as it’s on a computer).<br><br>

    Anyway, I said this would be brief, so I’ll leave the article here. I don’t know how long these will be in the future, but only time will tell. Thanks for reading, Rohan signing off.
